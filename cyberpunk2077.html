            <p><strong>cyberpunk 2077</strong> Cyberpunk 2077 & Phantom Liberty Review: Is It Worth Your Time and Money?
                Introduction
                When Cyberpunk 2077 launched in December 2020, it was met with a mix of excitement and disappointment. The game promised an immersive open-world RPG set in the dystopian future of Night City, but it was plagued by bugs, performance issues, and missing features. Fast forward to 2023, with the release of Phantom Liberty and the game-changing Update 2.0, Cyberpunk 2077 has undergone a complete transformation.
                <br>
                
                Is it finally the game we were promised? More importantly, is Phantom Liberty worth buying? Let's dive into the details.
                <br>
                
                Cyberpunk 2077 Base Game Review
                Story & Worldbuilding ‚Äì A Narrative Masterpiece
                At its core, Cyberpunk 2077 tells the story of V, a mercenary implanted with the digital ghost of legendary rockerboy Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). The plot is a mix of corporate espionage, crime syndicates, and existential dilemmas, offering a variety of choices that shape the story‚Äôs outcome.
                <br>

                <ul class="no-dots">
                    Strengths:
                    
                    <li>‚úÖ Deep, branching story with multiple endings</li>
                    <li>‚úÖ Well-developed characters, especially Johnny Silverhand</li>
                    <li>‚úÖ A visually stunning and immersive open world in Night City</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                
               
                <ul class="no-dots">
                    Weaknesses:
                    <li>‚ùå Some side quests can feel disconnected from the main narrative  </li>
                  
                </ul>
                <br>
                
                Gameplay ‚Äì Improved, but Not Perfect
                At launch, the gameplay felt unfinished, but Update 2.0 has significantly overhauled the experience:
                
                Combat feels smoother, with new perks and improved enemy AI.
                
                Hacking and stealth are now viable playstyles, making Netrunners more powerful.
                
                Vehicles now have combat capabilities, making car chases actually fun.
                
                Police AI has been revamped, meaning you can no longer just escape by driving a block away.
                
                However, while these improvements make the game much better, some mechanics still lack depth, such as melee combat and the life path choices (which still don‚Äôt impact gameplay significantly).
                
                Graphics & Performance ‚Äì Then vs. Now
                Originally, Cyberpunk 2077 was infamous for being unplayable on last-gen consoles, but after multiple patches:
                
                On PC & Next-Gen (PS5, Xbox Series X): The game is stunning, with ray tracing and improved performance.
                
                On PS4 & Xbox One: The game is technically "playable" but still not recommended due to poor frame rates.
                
                The game now runs smoothly on modern hardware, making it a solid experience for those who skipped the launch disaster.

                Phantom Liberty Expansion Review
                What‚Äôs New in Phantom Liberty?
                Phantom Liberty is a spy-thriller expansion that introduces a brand-new district (Dogtown) and an entirely new storyline featuring Idris Elba as Solomon Reed, a veteran secret agent. Unlike the base game, this expansion leans more into espionage, deception, and high-stakes action.
